Hashicorp Consul API Java Client
================================
This is a Java client for consuming from the Hashicorp Consul API (http://consul.io)
Supports all [API](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/api-docs) endpoints, all consistency modes and parameters (tags, datacenters etc.)

For additional information such as how to use this client, please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/jon5477/consul-api/wiki) page.

Library Dependencies:
---------------------
- SLF4J (2.x)
- Jackson Databind (for JSON processing)

Requirements:
-------------
- Java 11 (for the Java HTTP client)

Notes:
------
This project has been forked from the [Ecwid/consul-api](https://github.com/Ecwid/consul-api) project and heavily modified to address the following issues:
- Vulnerable maven dependencies (with open CVEs)
  - Apache HTTP Client 4.x
  - GSON
- Replaced Apache HTTP Client with built-in [HttpClient](https://openjdk.org/groups/net/httpclient/intro.html) - available since Java 11
- Various Consul API deprecations and removals
  - Reworked ACL endpoint (legacy ACL was removed since Consul v1.11.x)
  - node-meta query specifier on [catalog](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/api-docs/catalog#node-meta) and [health](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/api-docs/health#node-meta-1) - deprecated since Consul v1.9.x
  - tag query specifier on [health](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/api-docs/health#tag) - deprecated since Consul v1.9.x
  - token query parameter - [deprecated](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/api-docs/v1.13.x/api-structure) and warned against since Consul v1.13.x
- Various secure coding standards (handle sensitive Java text data as `char[]`)
  - `CharSequence` is provided as a compatibility-layer for legacy code, but it is highly recommended to use `char[]`
  - Allow specifying your own `SSLContext` and `SSLParameters` implementations (important for secure TLS in Java) - `TlsConfig` has been kept (but deprecated), it is advised to migrate off using `TlsConfig` due to its built-in insecurities
- API has been tested against Consul 1.18.1 ([ecwid](https://github.com/Ecwid/consul-api/blob/232550b44e122f42446876835946baf2de333f53/src/test/java/com/ecwid/consul/ConsulTestConstants.java#L5) tests against Consul 1.6.0)
